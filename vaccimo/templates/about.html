                        participants who reported their experiences to us. VACCIMO is not required to assess whether
                        a vaccination caused a health problem, but it is particularly beneficial for spotting odd or
                        unexpected patterns of adverse event reporting that may signal a probable vaccine safety
                        concern. In this manner, VACCIMO can give us with pertinent information indicating that
                        extra study and investigation are required to better examine a potential safety problem.
                        VACCIMO offers individual and confidential health check-ins via app, allowing users and
                        easily share how you or your dependents are feeling after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. This
                        data enables us to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in order to monitor. </p>
