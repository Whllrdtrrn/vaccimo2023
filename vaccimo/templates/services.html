                    <p> Vaccimo contains valuable information to vaccine safety specialists, allowing them to
                        examine any vaccination safety risks, including the different kind of COVID-19
                        vaccines.
                            It is especially beneficial for spotting unusual or unexpected patterns of health issues
                            (also known as "adverse events") that may suggest a potential vaccination safety risk.
                            Severe reactions that might
                            lead to long-term health problems are exceedingly rare after any immunization,
                            particularly COVID-19 vaccination. If side effects do develop, they usually occur within
                            six weeks of getting a vaccination
                            dose.
